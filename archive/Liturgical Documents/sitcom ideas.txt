Zach, Nicholas, and I go on a tangent about why there should be different saltine flavors (butter, garlic) while in the middle of an argument with black people after Zach drops an n bomb.

Henry not being a vault.

Person who speaks in filler.

Guy who gets all of his clothes from the lost and found.

I walk up behind a black man in a suit and say "This is insane, I feel empowered by proxy."

Zach orders a large milk from McDonalds, comes inside and complains to the cashier that there is no milk option on the soda fountains.

Owen being a mix between a hippie who does yoga and claims to be "spiritual" and a nazi. Drinks a mixture of deer pee and owl feathers in an attempt to grow his foreskin back.

Jason: "I need pp restore." Me: "Jason, what happened?"

I have a secret collection of clifford vhs tapes.

Hot peanut butter beverage.

I zipbomb my 3ds.

"Head Nod Lucas"

Zach: "Phineas and Ferb can suck each of my nuts."

"Dr. Milton"

Jesse having a fetish for autistic black women.

Aidan in reference to Lincoln Loud's personality in R34: "He's a brad-type character. Douche-canoe, but he's studly."

Jason: "You wouldn't get it. Pussy, that is."

Me: "We should have a down syndrome collection." referencing a collection of pictures of people with down syndrome.

Me: "I wish you could rape people in roblox"

Jesse using "J" instead of just leading to inevitable confusion.

Me going on Asian dating websites.

I become Dave-Dave

"Go fish is the white man's Uno."

"Naruto is undressing you as we speak"

"If I was a rectal doctor I could help you, but I'm afraid you'll need to seek a professional"

"Anarcho-Frontierist"

New reporter approaches Zach with a camera and microphone and asks "Mr. Dawson, Sigmund Freud said 'The ego is the true location of anxiety', what is your response to these attacks on you by Mr. Freud?".

I call Pizza Hut and after ordering a pizza I ask "Could you also throw in some dipping sticks on the house?" Aidan refers to this as, quote, "..one of the saddest questions in the English language."

Me: "Where do people with every mental illness in the book get the gall to think that they should be recommending psychiatrists? These people are living proof that they fricked up their job."

Zach bribes psychiatrist to diagnose him with schizophrenia so he can use it as an excuse for his behavior.

Zach becomes an oil lobbyist and rips a cane from underneath an elderly woman to make a point about the fall of America if oil subsidies stop.

I become a motivational speaker and speak only in platitudes and useless advice that sounds good but is actually nonesense. Pausing after I say my stupid garbage to make it sound true. "Here I have a Nike shoe, this shoe is worth one trillion dollars... All of you are wearing clothing that you chose for a reason... Nike is making you into a walking billboard and laughing to the bank while it happens... If you walk away with one message here tonight it is that your ability to make yourself into a commodity is the greatest commodity you have..."	

"What do you think was the greatest invention of the 20th century?..." "The telephone? The airplane? The computer? All wrong... The greatest invention was the vaccuum cleaner." "Think about it, the vaccum single handedly cleaned thousands of rooms..." "Could Albert Einstein have invented nukes if his room was dirty with crap on the floor? Could Alexander Graham Bell have invented the telephone if he slipped on a dirty banana peel and died because he had to use a broom to clean, and we all know brooms aren't half as good at cleaning up trash as vaccuums?" "If you think about it, vaccuums are the invention that allowed all of the other inventions to exist, without vaccuum cleaners, we have no telephones, no cars, no computers, and no television" "The story of the vaccuum cleaner teaches us that Wonder is a constant, always strive to discover new things, reinvent yourself, and to take time to explore who you are before you try to *vaccuum* the world... Thank you ladies and gentlefricks."

Aidan takes his chick to an African restaraunt.

"Suave, it's like a vaccine for you hair."

Pedophilia by proxy

Lisa Gaming defamation trial

Someone who uses the most infuriating wording leading to confusion. Calls himself a simian instead of a human, calls dogs "woofers". Puts adjectives in the wrong order. He calls Clifford a "red big smart woofer", this sends me over the edge.

We see Walker and Brandon have their own sitcom
Ian — 08/26/2021
####################################### Nature Documentary #########################################################
Here we have two homo erectus in the flesh, both have had little success with women, so they turn to each other for compassion. Both known member of the Chaneyite clan. The tall one is dominant in physical encounters, locals in the area call him "walker" after his favorite past time. The fat one with no neck, named "Brandon" by locals, is the leader of the Chaneyites. Known for his intellect compared to his companion, he consumed his neck like a baby eating it's twin in the womb. 
As you can see, members of the Chaneyite clan utilize gamer headphones to identify fellow Chaneyites. 
An all male clan, women avoid the Chaneyite clan as if their life depends on it, because it often does. 
They have been known to tell jokes to each other, their soviet union jokes may not be funny to you or I, but to the homo erectus male, it is a vital moral booster. 
They live in squalor, they enjoy eating hot pockets and the worst school lunch option. They have been known to dip their pizza in ranch dressing, this barbaric practice has caused them to be treated as outcasts by the greater homo erectus community. 
Cooper Hobbs a recent silver back gorilla addition to the Chaneyite clan provides muscle to the group, however he has been known to rape female humans. 
One homo erectus member of the Chaneyite clan, known by locals as "Colin" has changed genders to provide pleasure to his clan. 
As you can see Brandon is doing a mating dance, unfortunately for Brandon, the only mate attracted was his lifelong companion Walker.
